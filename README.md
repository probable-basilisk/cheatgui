# Noita Cheat GUI
A basic in-game cheat menu

## Installation (Manual)
Get setup for mods (get on the modding tools beta branch). [Download
this repo as a .zip](https://github.com/probable-basilisk/cheatgui/archive/master.zip), and extract into your `Noita/mods/` directory (so this README
should end up in `Noita/mods/cheatgui/README.md`). Then enable
the 'cheatgui' mod through the in-game pause menu.

## Installation (Git)
You can git clone this repo directly into mods:
```
cd {your Noita install dir}/mods/
git clone https://github.com/probable-basilisk/cheatgui.git
```
Then enable the 'cheatgui' mod through the in-game pause menu.

## Note about paths
Right now I'm having the mod put all its files into the global `data/hax/`
path rather than into the mod-specific path, both because I'm lazy, and
also because I might want to cross-load some of these files from other things.
